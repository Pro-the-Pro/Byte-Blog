<p>
    Welcome to the second blog on ByteBlog! In this post, I will share the journey of creating ByteBlog,
    a platform dedicated to sharing knowledge and insights about technology, programming, and more.
</p>

<p>
    The idea for Byte Blog created when I wanted to practice my HTML and CSS but didnt know what to make.
    So I decided to create a blog/tech tips website where I could share what I learn as I learn it.
</p>

<p>
    This website is increadably likely to change but to show how it has started I will style this webpage with a seperate css file
    to preseve and show how the website has changed over time as I learn more about web development. This css file will only be changed if I need to add new 
    styles to get back to the site but overal will reflect this sites original look and feel.
</p>

<p>
    I hope you enjoy Byte Blog and thank you for checking it out!
