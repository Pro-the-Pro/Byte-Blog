    I know this website is a tech blog website but as a PC gamer I thought I would share some of my favourite games 
    that I played and realy enjoyed this year.
</p>

<p>
    1. <b>Portal & Portal 2</b> - Whether you like action or puzzle these games are for you.
    Personally I love portal 2 because it has the most action but portal 1 is an amazing introduction to the series.
    As well as being a puzzle game it also has one of the best story lines I have seen in games and certainly my favourite.
    I wont spoil the story too much but to put it simply shoot portal complete puzzles and escape the facility.
</p>

<p>
    2. <b>Subnautica</b> - This is an amazing game that I have played hours of swimming through the ocean 
	of an amazing alien world. This game is one of my favourites because it combines exploration survival and horror.
	The game starts with a crash landing on an alien ocean planet and you alone have to survive, build and escape.
	You can even build underwater bases and submarines to help you survive past your lifepod.
</p>

<p>
	3. <b>Trailmakers</b> - This game is vehicle building game where you collect parts and build 
	vehicles to your hearts content. You then use those vehicles to find more materials to build more vehicles.
	You can build anything from cars to planes to boats and even space rockets (eventually).
</p>

<p>
	4. <b>Poly Bridge 1, 2 or 3</b> - These games are the best bridge building simulators I have ever played.
	They are a great way to learn about engineering and physics while having fun. I actually really like playing these
	games to chill out and relax because there not stressful at all and you can take all the time you need perfecting your bridges.
</p>

<p>
	5. <b>Cities: Skylines</b> - This game I have played for hours and hours and still love building cities.
	Its incredibly fun to build and manage a massive city with hundreds of millions of people.
	The games main and only objective is to build the biggest functioning city you can.
