## System Architecture

**Frontend Architecture**
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript static website with no frameworks
- Multi-page application with separate HTML files for different sections
- Shared CSS stylesheet (`style.css`) for consistent styling across all pages
- Simple button-based navigation between pages using `onclick` handlers
- Responsive design with viewport meta tags for mobile compatibility

**Content Organization**
- Hierarchical directory structure separating content types:
  - Root level: Main pages (index, about)
  - `/blogs/`: Blog posts and blog listing page
  - `/tips/`: Tips section (currently placeholder content)
- Each section maintains its own subdirectory with relative linking back to parent directories

**Styling Strategy**
- Centralized CSS with reusable classes (`.center-text`, `.header`, `.blogcontent`)
- Consistent header component across all pages with navigation buttons
- Color scheme using green buttons (#15a31a) for navigation and blue (#011aff) for general buttons
- Typography using Arial font family with responsive sizing

**Development Server**
- Python HTTP server (`server.py`) for local development and Replit hosting
- Configured to serve static files from current directory
- Runs on `0.0.0.0:5000` to meet Replit's external access requirements
- Simple file serving without any backend processing or dynamic content generation

**Deployment Strategy**
- Designed for static hosting (currently on GitHub Pages)
- No server-side processing required for production deployment
- All content is pre-rendered HTML with no build process needed

## External Dependencies

**Hosting Platforms**
- GitHub Pages for production deployment (https://pro-the-pro.github.io/Byte-Blog/)
- Replit for development environment with Python HTTP server

**Development Tools**
- Python 3 built-in `http.server` module for local development
- No external CSS frameworks or JavaScript libraries
- No content management system or database dependencies

**Browser Compatibility**
- Standard HTML5 and CSS3 features only
- No external font loading or third-party resources
- Vanilla JavaScript for basic navigation functionality
